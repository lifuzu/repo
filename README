This repo is forked from android.git.kernel.org/tools/repo.git, which is not stable recently, like

"
repo init ....
repo sync -b BRANCH_NAME
"

NOTICE: you need to change your repo script at your local image, you can find it with command "which repo", to replace this file with "", for example:

$ which repo
/home/build/bin/repo
$ curl https://raw.github.com/lifuzu/repo/master/repo > /home/build/bin/repo
$ chmod +x /home/build/bin/repo

then you need to remove your old ~/.repoconfig since the new one with different gpg key signing. Don't worry, this folder can be generated automatically at next run "repo init".

build@dhabuildimage30:~$ rm -fr ~/.repoconfig
